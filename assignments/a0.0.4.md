### [Assignment4] Authentication 

Using the hapi-auth-cookie plugin: 
    * add a new /private endpoint protected by a username and password that returns a 
      simple HTML page with a welcome message.  The welcome message should include the logged in username. 
    * Do not use any templates (views) at this stage. 
    * For username/password validation, create a static lib/users.json file 
      (we will replace this in the near future) that contains a few sample users and passwords.

The new endpoint (/private) will be contained in its own plugin, similar to how we set up /version, 
and will require bringing test coverage back to 100%.
